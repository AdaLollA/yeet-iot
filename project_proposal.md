## Scenarios

Our protagonist is called Yeet. He is ... and his occupation is .... 

#### Scenario #1
Yeet arrives home and wants to get into the house. He takes out his RFID chip, holds it on the scanner and the door unlocks.

#### Scenario #2
The brightness sensor continually measures the brightness in the room and the Philip Hue lights in the house, if turned on, are dimmed accordingly to the brightness in the room.

#### Scenario #3
Yeet is very sensitive to dry air in his flat. Using his home automation skills he connected his air damper to a Z-Wave plug. A humidity sensor provides values how dry the air is and once a certain threshold is reached, the plug is activated and the air damper starts running to make the air more humid.

#### Scenario #4
Yeet has a date with his soon-to-be third girlfriend. He is in a hurry and leaves the house but forgets to water his favorite plant. This, however, is no big deal as he installed a DIY watering system for his favorite plant. A water pump is triggered as soon as the respective humidity, brightness, and temperature sensor reach a certain combined value.

#### Scenario #5
Gas/fire sensor for detecting burning stove?
